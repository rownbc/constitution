================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agreement of Corporation. In order to induce the members of the Board of Governors and the officers of the Corporation to serve as such, the Corporation adopts this Article and agrees to provide the Board members and officers of the Corporation with the benefits contemplated hereby.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acceptance of Board Members or Officers. This Article will apply, and the benefits hereof will be available, to each Board member and officer of the Corporation who by accepting his or her respective position and serving on behalf of the Corporation will be deemed to have accepted the provisions of this Article and agreed to abide by the terms contained herein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitions. As used herein, the following terms will have the following respective meanings: "Covered Act" means any act or omission by the Indemnified Person in the Indemnified Person's official capacity with the Corporation and while serving as such or while serving at the request of the Corporation as a member of the governing body, officer employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. "Excluded Claim" has the meaning set forth in Section 15.6, hereof. "Expenses" means any reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of any claim made against the Indemnified Person for Covered Acts including, without being limited to, legal, accounting or investigative fees and expenses (including the expense of bonds necessary to pursue an appeal of an adverse judgment). "Indemnified Person" means any Board member or officer of the Corporation who accepts election or appointment as a Board member or officer and agrees to serve as such in the manner provided in Section 15.2 hereof. "Loss" means any amount which the Indemnified Person is legally obligated to pay as a result of any claim made against the Indemnified Person for Covered Acts including, without being limited to, judgments for, and awards of, damages, amounts paid in settlement of any claim, any fine or penalty or, with respect to an employee benefit plan, any excise tax or penalty. "Proceeding" means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indemnification. Subject to the exclusions hereinafter set forth, the Corporation will indemnify the Indemnified Person against and hold the Indemnified Person harmless from any Loss or Expenses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advance Payment of Expenses. The Corporation will pay the Expense of the Indemnified Person in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding except to the extent that the defense of a claim against the Indemnified Person is undertaken pursuant to any Board members' and officers' liability insurance (or equivalent insurance known by another term) maintained by the Corporation. The advance payment of Expenses will be subject to the Indemnified Person's first agreeing in writing with the Corporation to repay the sums paid by it hereunder if it is thereafter determined that the Proceeding involved an Excluded Claim or that the Indemnified Person was otherwise not entitled to indemnity under these bylaws.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exclusions. The Corporation will not be liable to pay any Loss or Expenses (an "Excluded Claim"): (a) With respect to a Proceeding in which a final non-appealable judgment or other adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Person is liable to the Corporation (as distinguished from being liable to a third party) for: (i) any breach of the Indemnified Person's duty of loyalty to the Corporation; (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve  intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law; or (iii) any transaction from which the Indemnified Person derived an improper personal benefit; or (b) If a final, non-appealable judgment or other adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such payment is unlawful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice to Corporation; Insurance. Promptly after receipt by the Indemnified Person of notice of the commencement of or the threat of commencement of any Proceeding, the Indemnified Person will, if indemnification with respect thereto may be sought from the Corporation under these bylaws, notify the Corporation of the commencement thereof. Failure to promptly notify the Corporation will not adversely affect the Indemnified Person's right to indemnification hereunder unless and only to the extent that the Corporation is materially prejudiced in its ability to defend against the Proceeding by reason of such failure. If, at the time of the receipt of such notice, the Corporation has any directors' and officers' liability insurance in effect, the Corporation will give prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurer in accordance with the procedures set forth in the policy or policies in favor of the Indemnified Person. The Corporation will thereafter take all the necessary or desirable action to cause such insurer to pay, on behalf of the Indemnified Person, all Loss and Expenses payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indemnification Procedures. (a) Payments on account of the Corporation's indemnity against Loss will be made by the Treasurer except if, in the specific case, a determination is made that the indemnification of the Indemnified Person is not proper in the circumstances because such Loss results from a claim which is an Excluded Claim. If the Corporation determines that the Loss results from an Excluded Claim (although no such determination is required by the Corporation hereunder prior to payment of a Loss by the Treasurer), the determination shall be made: (i) By the Board of Governors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Board members not at the time parties to the Proceeding; or (ii) If a quorum cannot be obtained for purposes of clause (i) of this subparagraph (a), then by a majority vote of a committee of the Board of Governors duly designated to act in the matter by a majority vote of the full Board (in which designation Board members who are parties to the Proceeding may participate) consisting solely of three or more Board members not at the time parties to the Proceeding; or (iii) By independent legal counsel designated: (A) by the Board of Governors in the manner described in clause (i) of this subparagraph (a), or by a committee of the Board of Governors established in the manner described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph (a), or (B) if the requisite quorum of the full Board cannot be obtained and a committee cannot be established, by a majority vote of the full Board (in which designation Board members who are parties to the Proceeding may participate). If made, any such determination permitted to be made by this subparagraph (a) will be made within 60 days of the Indemnified Person's written request for payment of a Loss. (b) Payment of an Indemnified Person's Expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding will be made by the Treasurer except if, in the specific case, a determination is made pursuant to Section 15.8(a) above that indemnification of the Indemnified Person is not proper in the circumstances because the Proceeding involved an Excluded Claim. (c) The Corporation will have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any Indemnified Person against liability asserted against him or her with respect to any Covered Act, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such Indemnified Person against such liability under the provisions of this Article. The Corporation will be subrogated to the rights of such Indemnified Person to the extent that the Corporation has made any payments to such Indemnified Person in respect to any Loss or Expense as provided herein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Settlement. The Corporation will have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person under this Article for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding affected without the Corporation's prior written consent. The Corporation will not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any proposed settlement. If the Corporation consents to the settlement of any proceeding, or unreasonably withholds or delays such consent, it will be conclusively and irrefutably presumed for all purposes that the Loss or Expense does not constitute an Excluded Claim. If the Corporation reasonably withholds its consent solely on the ground that the Proceeding constitutes an Excluded Claim, the Indemnified Person may accept the settlement without the consent of the Corporation, with out prejudice to the Indemnified Person's rights to indemnification in the event the Corporation does not ultimately prevail on the issue of whether the Proceeding constitutes an Excluded Claim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rights Not Exclusive. The rights provided hereunder will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnified Person may be entitled under any agreement, vote of disinterested Board members or otherwise, both as to action in the indemnified Person's official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding such office, and will continue after the Indemnified Person ceases to serve the Corporation as an Indemnified Person.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enforcement. (a) The Indemnified Person's right to indemnification hereunder will be enforceable by the Indemnified Person in any court of competent jurisdiction and will be enforceable notwithstanding that an adverse determination has been made as provided in Section 15.8 hereof. (b) In the event that any action is instituted by the Indemnified Person under these bylaws, the Indemnified Person will be entitled to be paid all court costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the Indemnified Person with respect to such action, unless the court determines that each of the material assertions made by the Indemnified Person as a basis for such section was not made in good faith or was frivolous.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severability. If any provision of this Article is determined by a court to require the Corporation to perform or to fail to perform an act which is in violation of applicable law, this Article shall be limited or modified in its application to the minimum extent necessary to avoid a violation of law, and, as limited or modified, this Article shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Successor and Assigns. The provisions of this Article will be (a) binding upon all successors and assigns of the Corporation (including any transferee of all or substantially all of its assets) and (b) binding on and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, and other personal representatives of the Indemnified Person.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amendment. No amendment or termination of this Article will be effective as to an Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of that Indemnified Person and, in any event, will not be effective as to any Covered Act of the Indemnified Person occurring prior to the amendment or termination.
