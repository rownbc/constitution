# DRILL OF THE CLUB.

The coxswain will call the crew together by a BoatSwains whistle, Which shall be used for no other signal--designate the men to launch the boat--the station which
each man is to occupy on board, and the manner of entering, the boat, and will give all. such orders, as by the circumstances of the time shall be rendered necessary fer
the good ordering and discipline of the crew, or for the
safety of the boat.

The stroke-oarsman will see that the oars are properly stowed on board, and such. other furniture as may be ordered. When the boat is in- a proper situation he shall see that the rudder is hung—-the fiag-staff stepped, and that the boat is in a proper position for the reception of the Coxswain, &c.

The bow—man will assist the stroke oars-man in his general charge of the boat, &c., step the signal staff and hoist the signal--coil away the painter, and will see to the safe mooring of the boat. When not on duty, he will be careful in all his movements not to disturb the trim of the boat.

The coxswain having taken his seat, he will command.

> *"Shove Off !"*

The order will be executed by the stroke oars-man and bow-man, after which, they Will stow in their boat hooks, and take their station at the oars, (if the bow-man has one assigned him.)

> *"Ready !"*

Each man will lay his hands upon his oar in such a manner, as shall be most convenient to throw them to a perpendicular position.

> *"Toss !"*

The oars will be brought to a perpendicular position, the handle resting on the foot nearest the centre of the boat, the edges of the blade ranging fore and aft.

> *"Let Fall !"*

The oars Will be dropped into the rowlocks, the fiat of the blade gently striking the water. Each man will sit close to the gunwale, slightly facing towards-the blade of his oar.

> *"Give Way !"*

The oarsmen will immediately incline their bodies astern, threw, their oars as far forward as possible, being careful that the loom shall not come in contact with the oars-man in front, and also moving in regular time with the stroke oar. If at any time it becomes requisite to change the course of the boat, the command will be

> *"Starboard or Larboard ’bout !"*"

When the oarsmen designated will cease exerting their strength, and will merely dip their oars, preserving the motion of the stroke oar; or if the change is to be made is within a given space, the command will be

> *"Starboard or Larboard Hold !"*

At which command, the oars designated Will be suffered to-remain in the water, care being had that the ear is but slightly buried; or if it is desired to turn the boat upon its ground, the command will be

> *"Starboard or Larboard Stern !"*"

When the oars-men designated will reverse the usual stroke and continue until the command is given

> *"Give Way !"*

At which, the pull upon the oar will be resumed. To check the headway of the boat suddenly, or to give it stern-way, the command Will be

> *"Stem All !"*

When the oars-men Will stop pulling, and push the loom of the oar from them, until the required position is attained.

> *"Rest !"*

The oars shall be lifted from the water, and kept horizontal and feathered. Through all the drill the strictest silence will be observed excepting after the execution of the command

> *"Apeak !"*

When the handle of the oar will be placed under them gunwale, with the blades parallel with each other. In this position silence will not be required.

In any situation where there is not sufficient room to pass with the oars in play, the coxswain my command

> *"Trail !"*

When the oar is to be thrown out of the rowloch, by grasping it with the hand nearest the centre of the boat, «gem the blades from striking the bowman.  throw the handles of their oars sufficiently astern to pre-

In approaching a landing, if danger is apprehended the coxswain will command the bow-man to
